# Vehicle Detection and Tracking with YOLOv8, YOLOv5, Deep SORT, Roboflow
This comprehensive project presents an advanced vehicle detection and tracking system, harnessing the capabilities of state-of-the-art computer vision technologies. By seamlessly integrating YOLOv8 and YOLOv5 for precision vehicle detection and implementing the Deep SORT algorithm with Kalman filters for robust tracking, we've created a versatile solution for real-time vehicle monitoring.

## Features
### Dual Detection Models
We've seamlessly integrated YOLOv8 and YOLOv5 for vehicle detection. YOLOv8 offers feature fusion capabilities, while YOLOv5 provides lightweight and efficient detection. This combination enhances our ability to accurately detect vehicles of various types and sizes.
### Tracking with Deep SORT: 
Our system incorporates the Deep SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm, enriched with Kalman filters, to provide precise and smooth vehicle tracking.
### Roboflow Augmentation:
To enhance the model's performance, we employed Roboflow for dataset augmentation. This strategic augmentation helps mitigate overfitting and generalizes the model for a wider range of scenarios.
### Real-time Performance: 
Our integrated model excels in real-time or near-real-time vehicle detection and tracking, ideal for applications like traffic monitoring and surveillance.
### Multi-class Detection: 
While YOLOv8 provides overall vehicle detection, YOLOv5 is fine-tuned for detecting cars and trucks specifically, enabling precise tracking of these specific vehicle types.
